This be me plans fer Talk Like a Pirate Day. They went off perfectly, an' nary a man complained 'bout the noise. All o' them, o' atleast the ones I talked with, praised me poster too. I be presentin' me path in the form o' instructions, just 'cause it made it more fun:
</p>
<p>
Step 1: Give a little bit o' warnin'. The other's will need some idea o' what's goin' on, and ye'll need at least three full days o' preparin' an' plannin', like from Monday t' Wednesday if the holiday be on Thursday. But make sure not t' tell anyone what yer plannin', no matter how hard it be t' keep it in, an' hide all yer stuff as ye make it.</p>

<p>
Step 2: Prepare e-mails fer yer friends an' family- the lily livered landlubbers! Include some treats, like a "piratized" Haverford webpage, Google with the language set t' pirate, the official Talk Like a Pirate Day song and the official Talk Like a Pirate Day website- plus a sound clip o' ye yelling "Yarrr, it be Talk Like a Pirate Day!" at the top o' yer lungs tha' ye made in one o' the music-practicin' rooms in Union so no one in the house could here it and guess what ye were doin'
</p>

<p>
Step 3: Find a way t' safely serenade yer housemates without them changin' the music from the best song o' all- "He's a Pirate" from the Pirates o' the Caribbean soundtrack <br>(<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wxzuKwCXyk">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wxzuKwCXyk</a>)</br>

<p>
Step 4: Prepare a message fer any visitors t' the house so they know what they be gettin' into

<p>
Step 5: Make a Talk Like a Pirate Day poster. If ye don't have posterboard, staple regular paper together. If ye got some posterboard but ye already stapled the paper, posterboard makes a great thing t' use as a table If yer makin' it in secret. I suggest puttin' it in a window. Make sure t' include some bonuses, like a treasure map t' <b>Yarrrrrr</b>nall an' the ole Jolly Roger

<p>
Step 6: Make sure that ev'ryone sees yer poster by labelin' ev'rythin' t' point at it

<p>
Step 7: Set up yer speaker (or one tha' ye asked beforehand if ye could borrow fer a few hours overnight an' in the mornin'), but make it clear tha' if someone wants t' partypoop instead o' partyin' on the poop deck, they know how t' turn it off, but also tha' it be their responsibility t' turn it on again

<p>
Step 8: Print out the lyrics t' the Talk Like a Pirate Day so tha' if anyone asks ye why yer talkin' like a pirate, ye can answer them- in song! Mayhaps ev'n give a performance or two fer a small group the night before
</p>

<p>
Step 9: Set yer alarms t' 6:30. As soon as they go off, jump out o' bed and grab all yer stuff and yer backpack. Set up ev'rythin' quietly without wakin' anyone. As yer last step, start the music. Crank it high enough that it be quite loud right next t' it and loud enough t' hear in the hallway upstairs, if not the rooms. Yer gonna have t' be quick and quiet as ye run upstairs t' check if the volume's just right. If yer amazingly lucky, neither ye nor yer music will wake anyone up.
	Now run and let them discover it fer themselves. Don't return fer at least two hours, an' then only t' check tha' ev'rythin's still working fine- ye wouldn't want anyone t' miss it, ev'n late sleepers! Don't turn off the music till after class at 11:30, when ev'ryone's sure to have already enjoyed the siren song o' "He's a Pirate." An' finally don't ferget t' live up t' yer promises- even if ye won't talk like a pirate, take notes like one!
